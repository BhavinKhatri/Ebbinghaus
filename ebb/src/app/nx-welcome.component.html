                What is the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, a fundamental principle of memory retention, shows that we tend to
                forget newly acquired information rapidly, but the rate of forgetting can be significantly reduced with
                the right techniques. At {{APP_NAME}}, we've harnessed this scientific insight to help you remember and
                recall information with greater ease.
